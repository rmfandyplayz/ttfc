Explain when they should be used.	text video	Scout Sign: Use when reciting the scout oath, law, and outdoor code. || Scout Salute: Use when reciting the pledge of allegiance hand salute to the flag of USA || Scout Handshake: Use it exclusively for scouting to show friendship.	no	https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1c6BQFVW3VxSSGCBU5FsL8nSVmxUgWijh	no	-	testImage4
1-1-4	S	1d	Describe the First Class Scout badge and tell what each part stands for. Explain the significance of the First Class Scout badge.	image	-	no	https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Firstclassemblem.jpg	no	-	testImage3
1-1-5	S	1e	Repeat from memory the Outdoor Code. In your own words, explain what the Outdoor Code means to you.	text	"As an American, I will do my best, to be clean in my outdoor manners, to be careful with fire, to be considerate in the outdoors, and to be conservation-minded." || Meaning: You will still use your manners outdoors just like you're indoors. You will be careful with fire. Don't play with fire. Be considerate. Don't destroy nature. Leave the place better than you found it. And most importantly, conserve resources as they're limited!	no	-	no	-	
1-1-6	S	1f	Repeat from memory the Pledge of Allegiance. In your own words, explain its meaning.	text	"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."

1-2-0	S	2	After attending at least one Boy Scout troop meeting, do the following:	none	none	none	none	none	none	
1-2-1	S	2a	Describe how the Scouts in the troop provide its leadership.	text	There isn't a straight answer to this. However, think about it: Who seems to be in charge of the troop? Who seems to be in charge of your patrol? There sure are scouts doing something "out of the ordinary," right? What are they doing? How does that seem to be helping the troop as a whole? 	no	-	no	-	
1-2-2	S	2b	Describe the four steps of Scout advancement.	text	1. You learn (pretty self explanatory! you learn all the requirements within a rank on your own). 2. You are tested (a scout leader tests you on a certain requirement and passes you on it). 3. You are reviewed (you meet up with the board of review to talk about your experience). 4. You are recognized (you rank up).	no	-	no	-	
1-2-3	S	2c	Describe the Scouts BSA ranks and how they are earned.	text	The scout rank covers the foundation of what it takes to be successful in scouting. Ranks from tenderfoot to first class tests your knowledge and skills on a huge variety of topics like camping, hiking, nature, fitness, etc. And lastly, star, life, and eagle rank mostly requires you to earn merit badges, be active in your troop, and take on responsibilities.	no	-	no	-	
1-2-4	S	2d	Describe what merit badges are and how they are earned.	text	Very similar to rank advancement. First, you pick what you want to learn. Then, you get someone that is eligible to teach and give out the award for such subject. After that, you work with said mentor, and then, you get your badge!	no	-	no	-	
1-3-1	S	3a	Explain the patrol method. Describe the types of patrols that are used in your troop.	text	The patrol method is a bit hard to explain, but it's basically scouts in a patrol doing activities together, having fun, and sharing knowledge. Types of patrols can vary within each troop. But commonly, they have a new-scout patrol that holds mostly the new scouts, a regular patrol with scouts around first class, and an older-scout patrol for the experienced scouts.	no	-	no	-	
1-3-2	S	3b	Become familiar with your patrol name, emblem, flag, and yell. Explain how these items create patrol spirit.	text	Patrol spirit is basically forming this special bonds between your "teammates." It's like a mix of teamwork and camaraderie (which means, mutual trust and friendship among people who spend a lot of time together). As for the become familiar part, we can't really help you with that, unfortunately. But, on the bright side, it's super simple! Ask your patrol members! Practice it! 	no	-	no	-	
1-4-1	S	4a	Show how to tie a square knot, two half-hitches, and a taut-line hitch. Explain how each knot is used.	text video	Square knots are very useful for tying things together with other ropes being similar in diameter. Two-half hitches are very commonly used to set up tents via securing the rope on a stake with the rope being connected to a tarp. Taut-line hitch is useful when it is constantly being pulled by some other force while still needing to readjust the length of the rope.	yes	https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1c6BQFVW3VxSSGCBU5FsL8nSVmxUgWijh	yes	https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0	Square_knot bowline
1-4-2	S	4b	Show the proper care of a rope by learning how to whip and fuse the ends of different kinds of rope.	video	(test)	no	-	yes	https://youtu.be/xvFZjo5PgG0	
1-5-0	S	5	Tell what you need to know about pocketknife safety.	text	Always keep the knife closed or the blade covered when not using. Don't have multiple knives open at once. Always close the knife before handing to someone else. Also make sure they say "Thank you" so that it is acknowledged that they are actually handling the tool correctly. Always keep your knife sharp for easier controllability. Obey the regulations of places with knife rules. Don't carry open blades, don't throw a knife unless the knife is intended for throwing and is under a controlled environment. Last but not least, the "Blood Circle" make sure that nobody is in the range where your knife could accidentally cut someone.	no	-	no	-	
1-6-0	S	6	With your parent or guardian, complete the exercises in the pamphlet "How to Protect Your Children From Child Abuse: A Parent's Guide" as well as earning the Cyber Chip Award for your grade.	text	You're on your own for this one! Just a few tips, though: the pamphlet should be found at the very beginning of your scoutbook, and the cyber chip is pretty simple. Just know that your internet activity can and will get tracked. So think about what you're posting before you post, and always be respectful to others online. And oh, just a message from the creators of the app, please don't follow stupid trends that can get you in trouble, or even worse, injured or killed! One last thing to remember, misinformation is EVERYWHERE. Ask for sources if someone makes a claim online. If there are no sources, it is almost certain that what they're talking about is false.	no	-	no	-	
1-7-0	S	7	Since joining the troop and while working on Scout rank, participate in a Scoutmaster conference.	text	This one should be simple! Your scoutmaster should be able to lead the conversation. Just a note from the creators, you have nothing to worry about for this requirement! Ask a scoutmaster during your scouts meeting to have a meeting for this requirement. During the meeting, just be yourself. It's not a "this is a test oh god I'm gonna fail!" situation!	no	-	no	-	
										
2-1-1	T	1a	Present yourself to your leader, prepared for an overnight camping trip. Show the personal and camping gear you will use. Show the right way to pack and carry it.	text	This isn't something we can help ya with! But here are some tips. First, make sure you actually bring everything. Camping gear heavily varies based on where you camp. But generally, you would have a sleeping bag, a sleeping pad, a pillow, toiletries, extra clothing, a mess kit, and your ten essentials, as always. Of course, you could definetly have way more than that depending on your situation. A good tip from us would be that you should always be organized to make the best out of the space you have in whatever contains your items. Good luck! You got this!	no	-	no		
2-1-2	T	1b	Spend at least one night on a patrol or troop campout. Sleep in a tent you have helped pitch.	text	Unfortunately, we can't magically teleport to ya and help you pitch a tent! But you know who can help you? The older scouts in your troop! They would know how to pitch a tent (hopefully). Because every troop may use a different brand/type of tent for camping, it is hard to suggest tutorials on how to pitch a tent! Though, a lot of the times, they will be quite similar. So looking it up on YouTube could help!	no	-	no		
2-1-3	T	1c	Tell how you practiced the Outdoor Code on a campout or outing.	text	As an American, you promise to be clean in your outdoor manners, be careful with fire, be considerate, and always be conservation minded. Practice this on your campouts! Don't mess around with fire (you definetly don't wanna start a forest fire. yea?). Clean up after yourself. Leave the place better than you found it. Pick up trash. Don't ruin the landscape.	no	-	no		
2-2-1	T	2a	On the campout, assist in preparing one of the meals. Tell why it is important for each patrol member to share in meal preparation and cleanup.	text	Because there are basically an infinite amount of combinations of food you can make, we can't help you with how to help cook a meal! But you know who would know? Your grubmaster! They are in charge of making the food, and you could definetly give 'em a helping hand! Along with helping prepare a meal, you also could participate in cleaning up dishes or your camp kitchen after meals. The work in a patrol should be evenly distributed because we work together!	no	-	no		
2-2-2	T	2b	While on a campout, demonstrate an appropriate method of safely cleaning items used to prepare, serve, and eat a meal.	text	This goes back to how to do the dishes, basically! Be sure to clean your utensils thoroughly! Make sure that you don't cross-contaminate food. Let's say there's a scout who's allergic to carrots. Then, if you used a knife to cut carrots, make sure to clean it before using the knife to cut anything else! You don't know how sensitive someone is to something until it's too late!	no	-	no		
2-2-3	T	2c	Explain the importance of eating together as a patrol.	text	Well, you won't die if don't eat with your patrol (hopefully), but it's always a good idea to get to know your teammates better! You're going to be with them for a while. So come on! Strike up a conversation while eating!	no	-	no		
2-3-1	T	3a	Demonstrate a practical use of the square knot.	text video	Square knots can be use to tie bandgaes, packages, and even joining two ropes together. So a good way to demonstrate this is to tie a box and lid together when the lid of said box isn't too functional.	no	-	yes	(placeholder)	
2-3-2	T	3b	Demonstrate a practical use of two half-hitches.	text video	Two half-hitches are useful if you need to tie a rope around a pole in which you can also manually adjust how tight the rope is. You can use this knot to tie down the rain fly of your tent.	no	-	yes	(placeholder)	
2-3-3	T	3c	Demonstrate a practical use of the taut-line hitch.	text video	Taut line hitches are somewhat similar to two half-hitches. This knot is useful if you need to tie the end of a rope onto a stake. You can combine this with the two half-hitches mentioned above. Use the taut line hitch to tie a rope around a stake, and use the two half-hitches on the other end to secure the rain fly of your tent.					
2-3-4	T	3d	Demonstrate proper care, sharpening, and use of the knife, saw, and ax. Describe when each should be used.	text	-					
2-4-1	T	4a	Show first aid for the following: Simple cuts and scrapes, blisters on the hand and foot, minor thermal/heat burns or scalds (superficial, first-degree), bites or stings of insects and ticks, venomous snake bite, nosebleed, frostbite and sunburn, and choking.	text	-					
2-4-2	T	4b	Describe common poisonous or hazardous plants; identify any that grow in your local area or campsite location. Tell how to treat for exposure to them.	text	Since we don't know where you live, we can't tell you what plants are near you! But most commonly, the three most well-known plants include the poison oak, ivy, and sumac. The treatment remains pretty much the same across all three. If you touch it, rinse it off with lukewarm water and soap as soon as possible. If not, try your best to not scratch it! But of course, the best way to deal with these nasties is to avoid 'em! Try to cover as much skin as possible when going through heavily-vegetated areas so the risk of your skin touching the poison plants stay as low as possible.					
2-4-3	T	4c	Tell what you can do while on a campout or other outdoor activity to prevent or reduce the occurrence of injuries or exposure listed in Tenderfoot requirements 4a and 4b. 	text	-					
2-4-4	T	4d	Assemble a personal first-aid kit to carry with you on future campouts and hikes. Tell how each item in the kit would be used.	text	In a common, lightweight, portable, and personal first-aid kit, you would need adhesive bandages (latex-free if you're allergic), gauze pads, adhesive tape, moleskin, soap and/or hand sanitizer, scissors, tweezers, disposable gloves, and CPR breathing barriers. You probably know how a bandage is used. Gauze pads are useful for controlling heavy wounds. You can use the tape to secure bandages and/or gauze(s). Usage of soap and hand sanitizer should be extemely obvious. Scissors are useful if you need to cut through things to apply first aid. Tweezers are useful to remove small things such as ticks. Gloves to prevent cross contamination, CPR breathing barriers just in case u don't wanna kiss whoever ur tryna rescue.					
2-5-1	T	5a	Explain the importance of the buddy system as it relates to your personal safety on outings and in your neighborhood. Use the buddy system while on a troop or patrol outing.	text	Let's say it's the middle of the night, and you suddenly have the urge to use the bathroom. You go without anyone and come face to face with a wild animal. The wild animal attacks you vicisouly while you're defenseless. You may also be a little bit of a distance away from your camp, so you can't actually walk back. This is where your life could potentially end. So what if you had someone with you? So let's say you get attacked. Yes, you get injured. But your buddy could fight the wild animal and perform basic first aid on you and call for help. You will always be safer with someone than if you're alone. Always grab someone with you if you will be somewhat distant from your troop.					
2-5-2	T	5b	Describe what to do if you become lost on a hike or campout.	text	STOP - (S)top moving, sit down and calm yourself. Then, (T)hink. Be aware of your current situation, your location, and how you got there in the first place. Sometimes, it might be good to just remain where you are because people will eventually start looking for you. (O)bserve. Can you somewhat determine where you are? Do you know the route to the nearest safe location? Is the weather going to get bad soon? Do you need to take shelter? (P)lan. Start making your moves. If you think you can get rescued, start making signals! If you can't get rescued... Well then, try your best to survive! It is always beneficial to learn about wilderness survival strategies in your spare time.					
2-5-3	T	5c	Explain the rules of safe hiking, both on the highway and cross-country, during the day and at night.	text	What's the most important is that you should always stay on trail. The shenanigans that happen off trail can be to an unimaginable level. Who knows? There could be a satanic ritual going on somewhere out there, and you definitely don't wanna be a part of that. (Just kiddding) Jokes aside - If you're hiking on a road, be sure to stick on the edges of the road the best you can, preferably in the bike lane. During the night, be sure to bring sources of light, which should be very obvious. Unfortunately, no you cannot craft potions of night vision (omg minecraft reference??!?!)					
2-6-1	T	6a	Record your best in the following tests: Push-ups (how many is done correctly in 60 seconds) / Sit-ups or curl-ups (number of times done correctly in 60 seconds) / Back-saver sit-and-reach (record the distance stretched) / 1 mile walk/run (record the time)	text	This, we can't really help you with! Everything here is up to you, and the requirement explains itself.					
2-6-2	T	6b	Develop and describe a plan for improvement in each of the activities listed in Tenderfoot requirement 6a. Keep track of your activity for at least 30 days.	text	Like 6a, there really isn't much we can do to help either! All we can say is, if you're getting not-very-good times, improve your diet, exercise more, and record what you do on a daily basis!					
2-6-3	T	6c	Show improvement (of any degree) in each activity listed in Tenderfoot requirement 6a after practicing for 30 days. Push-ups (how many is done correctly in 60 seconds) / Sit-ups or curl-ups (number of times done correctly in 60 seconds) / Back-saver sit-and-reach (record the distance stretched) / 1 mile walk/run (record the time)	text	The requirement explains itself lol (it's very obvious, is it not?)	no	-	yes	(placeholder)	
2-7-1	T	7a	Demonstrate how to display, raise, lower, and fold the American flag.	text video	This is better taught with a video instead of text instructions. See this video below:					
2-7-2	T	7b	Participate in a total of one hour of service in one or more service projects approved by your Scoutmaster. Explain how your service to others relates to the Scout slogan and Scout motto.	text	Do a good turn daily. It doesn't have to be like donating a few thousand dollars to someone unfortunate, even though it can be. It can simply be as simple as picking something up for someone, holding the door for people, or even having someone's back in a tough situation!					
2-8-0	T	8	Describe the steps in Scouting's EDGE method. Use the Teaching EDGE method to teach another person how to tie the square knot.	text	Explain, Demonstrate, Guide, Enable. First, you gotta explain the stuff to the scout. How does it work? Then, you demonstrate how it's done. After that, you let the scout do it but with guidance, and let them do it one more time without guidance.					
2-9-0	T	9	Demonstrate Scout spirit by living the Scout Oath and Scout Law. Tell how you have done your duty to God and how you have lived four different points of the Scout Law in your everyday life.	text	-					
2-10-0	T	10	While working toward the Tenderfoot rank, and after completing Scout rank requirement 7, participate in a Scoutmaster conference.	text	You did this before, and you can do it again. It's the same thing :) (From now on, answers to this requirement will always be the same)					
2-11-0	T	11	Successfully complete your board of review for the Tenderfoot rank.	text	A Board of Review (BOR for short) is like a job interview. Several volunteers who conduct this will ask you questions that probably are similar to what your scoutmaster will ask you in a conference. We can't help you much with this requirement as every troop might do their BOR's slightly differently. Be sure to ask the powerful scouts (aka SPL's or ASPL's or your patrol leader) on how to do this.					
										
3-1-1	SC	1a	Since joining Scouts BSA, participate in five separate troop/patrol activities, at least three of which must be held outdoors. Of the outdoor activities, at least two must include overnight camping. These activities do not include troop or patrol meetings. On campouts, spend the night in a tent that you pitch or other structure that you help erect, such as a lean-to, snow cave, or tepee.	text	Pretty self-explanatory! Go participate in some troop campouts!					
3-1-2	SC	1b	Explain the principles of Leave No Trace and tell how you practiced them on a campout or outing. This outing must be different from the one used for Tenderfoot requirement 1c.	text	Leave No Trace. Leave the place better than you found it. Don't litter. Don't play with fire. Follow the outdoor code. Pick up after yourself. When you leave, make sure that whatever campsite (as an example) you camped at does not look worse than before you pitched your tent.					
3-1-3	SC	1c	On one of these campouts, select a location for your patrol site and recommend it to your patrol leader, senior patrol leader, or troop guide. Explain what factors you should consider when choosing a patrol site and where to pitch a tent.	text	Depending on your patrol size and the type of terrain, you may or may not have to actually look for one. Let's say you're in a flat area. There really isn't a point of finding the "right place" as you can basically go anywhere as long as you're in the correct campside. But let's say you're in a mountainous region. You need to consider your patrol size as well as other patrols. If your patrol is large, it would be ideal if you guys take the largest available large flat space. However, if your patrol is small, you should be considerate and choose a smaller flat area to camp in!					
3-2-1	SC	2a	Explain when it is appropriate to use a fire for cooking or other purposes and when it would not be appropriate to do so.	text	This should be common sense! Use a fire for cooking, fusing a rope, boil water, start a campfire (if the campsite allows it), etc. But never play with fire. Don't light a match and throw it around, don't light random sticks on fire. Honestly, don't do stupid stuff with fire. There really isn't a good way to explain this!					
3-2-2	SC	2b	Use a pocketknife, and a saw or axe if needed, to prepare tinder, kindling, and fuel wood for a cooking fire.	text	Tinder (not the dating app) is the stuff that's really easy to light on fire. Kindling is what keeps the fire going. Use a pocketknife to cut small wood shavings if no better tinders are available (i.e. dry moss, dryer lint). Use a hatchet or axe to split large pieces of wood apart to sustain your fire. Be careful! Know your knife and axe safety!					
3-2-3	SC	2c	At an approved outdoor location and time, use the tinder, kindling, and fuel wood from Second Class requirement 2b to demonstrate how to build a fire. Unless prohibited by local fire restrictions, light the fire. After allowing the flames to burn safely for at least two minutes, safely extinguish the flames with minimal impact to the fire site.	text video	There's a ton of ways to build a fire, but the most common way to build a fire is the Teepee method. Look this up! There are tons of tutorials on this. We'll include one here as well.	no	-	yes	(place here later)	
3-2-4	SC	2d	Explain when it is appropriate to use a lightweight stove and when it is appropriate to use a propane stove. Set up a lightweight stove or propane stove. Unless prohibited by local fire restrictions, light the stove. Describe the safety procedures for using these types of stoves.	text video	Lightweight stoves should be used on a backpacking campout where every gram counts!	no	-	yes	(place here later)	
3-2-5	SC	2e	On one campout, plan and cook one hot breakfast or lunch, selecting foods from MyPlate or the current USDA nutritional model. Explain the importance of good nutrition. Demonstrate how to transport, store, and prepare the foods you selected.	text	-					
3-2-6	SC	2f	Demonstrate tying the sheet bend knot. Describe a situation in which you would use this knot.	text	-					
3-2-7	SC	2g	Demonstrate tying the bowline knot. Describe a situation in which you would use this knot.	text	-					
3-3-1	SC	3a	Demonstrate how a compass works and how to orient a map. Use a map to point out and tell the meaning of five map symbols.	text	-					
3-3-2	SC	3b	Using a compass and map together, take a 5-mile hike (or 10 miles by bike) approved by your adult leader and your parent or guardian.	text	-					
3-3-3	SC	3c	Describe some hazards or injuries that you might encounter on your hike and what you can do to help prevent them.	text	There are too many, but here are some examples. Poison plants: Prevent these by wearing clothing that covers your skin. Wild animals: Generally, you want to stop in your tracks, and move back slowly until it goes away. Unplesant/dangerous weather: Check the forecast. If it's gonna go full-on stormin', postpone your trip!					
3-3-4	SC	3d	Demonstrate how to find directions during the day and at night without using a compass or an electronic device.	text	Here's some common examples, although you should look up more on your own! During the day, you can use the sun to navigate. It always rises from the east, and sets in the west. During nighttime, you can try to find the North Star, which should be the brightest star in the night sky. The North Star will always point you to the north.					
3-4-0	SC	4	Identify or show evidence of at least 10 kinds of wild animals (such as birds, mammals, reptiles, fish, or mollusks) found in your local area or camping location. You may show evidence by tracks, signs, or photographs you have taken.	text	Search around! Do you see any animal tracks? Do you see poop of some sort that may signal towards what animal it is? Have you seen them right in front of you? Document them down! Take a picture (of course, don't disturb the animals! Do it from a distance.)!					
3-5-1	SC	5a	Tell what precautions must be taken for a safe swim.	text	First and most important: Check the weather. Make sure it's nice and pleasant outside. Don't go out swimmin' in a storm unless ya want to get yourself killed (which according to the internet, you have a 10% chance of death if you get struck by one. So better be safe than sorry!). Also, make sure you don't have any open wounds. Who tf knows what's in that water? You definitely don't want to get a disease, right? FYI there's a ton of diseases you can get from swimming with an open wound. Some can be life-threatening. 					
3-5-2	SC	5b	Demonstrate your ability to pass the BSA beginner test: Jump feet first into water over your head in depth, level off and swim 25 feet on the surface, stop, turn sharply, resume swimming, then return to your starting place.	text	-					
3-5-3	SC	5c	Demonstrate water rescue methods by reaching with your arm or leg, by reaching with a suitable object, and by throwing lines and objects.	text	-					
3-5-4	SC	5d	Explain why swimming rescues should not be attempted when a reaching or throwing rescue is possible. Explain why and how a rescue swimmer should avoid contact with the victim.	text	Should be pretty common sense. The victim is so desperate to stay afloat that they may or may not hold on to you so strongly that you drown yourself. Always attempt to make them grab onto something which you have full control of and could work with easily. Swimming to rescue someone should be your absolute last resort.					
3-6-1	SC	6a	Demonstrate first aid for the following: Object in the eye, bite of a suspected rabid animal, puncture wounds from a splinter, nail, and fishhook, serious burns (partial thickness, or second-degree), heat exhaustion, shock, heatstroke, dehydration, hypothermia, and hyperventilation.	text	-
