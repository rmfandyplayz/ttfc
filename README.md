# Well...

it appears that you've wandered into the source code of my app Trail To First Class\
I won't stop u from looking at my code and playing around with it. But please, please do not copy it for commercial purposes. If you wish to make a remaster or modified version and release it __without commercial purposes__ (aka you make zero money from the work), you may do so - but please give me some credit.\
If u DO release it for commercial purposes... then I probably won't even stop you bcuz i ain't paying lawyer fees. However, f#ck you for doing so. *(technically, TTFC IS patented and copyright protected)*
